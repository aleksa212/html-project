      Risotto (/rɪˈzɒtoʊ/, Italian: [riˈzɔtto, -ˈsɔt-], from riso meaning
      "rice")[1] is a northern Italian rice dish cooked with broth until it
      reaches a creamy consistency. The broth can be derived from meat, fish, or
      vegetables. Many types of risotto contain butter, onion, white wine, and
      Parmigiano-Reggiano. It is one of the most common ways of cooking rice in
      Italy. Saffron was originally used for flavour and its signature yellow
      colour.[2][3] Risotto in Italy is often a first course served before the
      main course, but risotto alla milanese is often served with ossobuco alla
      milanese as a main course.[4]
