      Pizza (English: /ˈpiːtsə/ PEET-sə, Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan:
      [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat
      base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often
      various other ingredients (such as various types of sausage, anchovies,
      mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then
      baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A
      small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is
      known as a pizzaiolo. In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented
      unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[2][3] In casual
      settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the
      hand. The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin
      manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border
      with Campania.[4] Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and
      its variants have since become popular in many countries.[5] It has become
      one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in
      Europe, the Americas and Australasia; available at pizzerias (restaurants
      specializing in pizza), restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, via
      pizza delivery, and as street food.[5] Various food companies sell
      ready-baked pizzas, which may be frozen, in grocery stores, to be reheated
      in a home oven.
